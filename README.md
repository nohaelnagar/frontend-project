Quick Headlines App
An Application built using React, Material UI, and the NewsAPI. This app allows users to stay updated with the latest news articles, search for specific topics, and filter news by category.

Features:
•	Fetch News Articles:
Uses the NewsAPI to fetch and display the latest news articles.
•	Search Functionality:
Provides a search bar to find articles by keywords.
•	Category Filter:
Includes a dropdown menu to filter news articles by category (e.g., general, business, technology).
•	Pagination:
Implements Next and Previous buttons to navigate through multiple pages of results.
•	Error Handling:
Displays user-friendly error messages when data loading fails.
•	Loading Experience:
Shows a loading splash screen while data is being fetched.
•	Styling:
Designed with Material UI components for a clean and modern user interface.

Technologies Used:
•	React: For building the user interface and managing state.
•	Material UI: For styling and creating responsive, reusable components.
•	NewsAPI: For fetching real-time news articles.
•	React Hooks: For state management (useState, useEffect) and side effects.
•	CSS Flexbox: For layout and alignment.

How It Works:
1.Fetching Data:
The app fetches news articles from the NewsAPI based on the selected category or search query.
2.Rendering Articles:
Articles are displayed in a list format, with each item showing the title, description, image, author, and publication date.
3.Search and Filter:
Users can search for articles by typing keywords in the search bar or filter articles by category using the dropdown menu.
4.Pagination:
Users can navigate through multiple pages of results using the Next and Previous buttons.
5.Error Handling:
If the API request fails, the app displays a clear error message to inform the user.
6.Loading State:
While data is being fetched, a loading splash screen is displayed to improve the user experience.
