News Feed App built using React, Material UI & NewsAPI
 
In this project, I will use React skills to create a Quick Headlines APP. The app will have the
following capabilities:
1. Use News API to get news articles
2. Render list of articles based on news API results
3. Provide a search bar to search articles by keywords
4. Provide Pagination (Next & Previous buttons) to navigate through more results
5. Provide Category dropdown to filter results based on category.
6. Improve the Error handling experience; Show error messages when loading data fails.
7. Improve Loading experience; use splash screen while data is loading.
8. Style using Material UI components.
